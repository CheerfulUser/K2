    "## Supernova research with Kepler/K2 ðŸŒŒ ðŸŒŸ \n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of Jupyter Notebooks is aimed at advancing supernova research with Kepler/K2.  Kepler and K2 have observed over 44,005 galaxies in the hope of serendipously recording the pre-outburst lightcurves of \"shock break-out\".  The mere existence and observation of such a phenomenon would be able to discriminate among theories of supernova catalysts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kepler prime mission observed 400 galaxies for an average of two years, detecting 6 supernovae.  K2 observes for a shorter time---about 80 days per campaign---but has targeted many more sources: 43,605 so far.  K2 campaigns 16 and 17 will observe many more galaxies.  The table below lists the number of galaxies observed in each K2 campaign.\n",

    "This coarse estimate assumes all supernovae have been found from the Kepler prime mission, and that different time-baseline windowing effects have negligible impact on detection efficiency.  In K2 Campaigns 3, 5, 6, 8, & 10 (so far), the KEGS team has identified at least 15 unpublished detections out of 19188 possible galaxies, about half as many as projected from the simple coarse projection from Kepler prime, but with data analysis still ongoing.  \n",

    "About 72 supernovae is probably in the ballpark of what we can expect--- of order many dozens or hundreds of supernovae in the K2 dataset.  This large number of supernovae with high precision, high cadence lightcurves will enable the study of the diversity of supernovae environments to identify which environments yield which outcomes."

    "Several barriers could hamper the analysis of Supernovae in K2 lightcurves.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intrinsic variability of host galaxies mask weak transient signals.\n",
    "2. Kepler's large ($\\sim4''$) pixels blend host galaxy and transient PSFs.\n",
    "3. Space-craft induced motion masks transient signals with pixel-flatfield artifacts\n",
    "4. The K2 field of view is usually unobservable contemporaneously from the ground, except in the rare forward-facing campaigns.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially no existing Kepler-produced lightcurve or High Level Science Product has been designed both to preserve transient, long-timescale, astrophysical signals, and to mitigate spurious instrumental artifacts.  Some of these challenges have been mitigated.  Extragalactic targets can be chosen to avoid AGN, or the AGN studied in their own right.  Near-contemporaneous ground-based data still exist for many fields.  Some transients---like Type Ia Supernovae---are bright enough to outshine the host galaxy and noise sources altogether."
